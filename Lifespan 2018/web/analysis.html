If he <mark>doesn’t improve</mark> his life style he could die in <mark>18</mark> years from today, in the year <mark>2036</mark>.</p>
        <p>If John F. Pavley lives beyond <mark>2036</mark> and the age of <mark>75</mark>, he will be living on borrowed time.</p>
        <p>The life clock of John F.

In this life clock each hour represents <mark>6.92</mark> years, each minute represents <mark>1.38</mark> months, and each second represents <mark>0.7</mark> days.</p>
        <p>If John F. Pavley is able to <mark>lower</mark> his mental stress and <mark>increase</mark> his physical activity he could <mark>add 16</mark> years to his life expectancy, live to the age of <mark>91</mark>, and see the dawn of New Year’s Day in <mark>2052</mark>.</p>
