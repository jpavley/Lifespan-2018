        <h1>A Note From the Designer/Engineer</h1>
        
        <p>Lifespan was created for entertainment and inspirational value. <em>Its analysis can’t predict how long you will live.</em> Hopefully you will have a long and fruitful life and live well into old age. But in case you need a reminder of how precious each hour of each day, Lifespan is here for you, in your pocket, on your phone, ready to help you be mindful and grateful.</p>
        
        <p>The idea of mapping a lifespan to the 12 hours of clock face came from reading articles on the difficulty we have of <em>accepting our own mortality</em> and the impact of our lifestyle on our longevity. Psychologically, the impact of having only few hours to live is much greater than an abstract number of years. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll check your lifeclock in the Lifespan app now and then and realize that we all only have a short time on this pale blue dot.</p>
        
        <p>Philosophers, Psychologists, and the wise of every tradition have long implored us <em>stop to behaving like immortals.</em> We need to remember that life is a limited gift. People who understand this do not take the gift of life for granted. It is easier for live to slip through our fingers than it is retain it. To live like a mortal is to live mindfully, awake to the joys and suffering around us, and to take care of ourselves and each other. We are all on the same train with the same destination.</p>
        
        <p>Lifespan is a toy. It’s a simple model of long a life might last and it gives you a few sliders which with to play around with. But no matter where you set the sliders, <em>you can’t live past 122 years</em>, at least not until a few more healthtech breakthroughs.</p>
        
        <p>While you’re waiting for the singularity or the fountain of youth, what are you going to do with your remaining lifespan. The clock is ticking. Will you spend that time wisely?</p>
        
        <p>My personal lifeclock is set to 8:14:27. I’ve spent several <em>seconds</em> designing and programming this app. The code is opened sourced under the MIT License and you can find it at http://github/jpavley/lifespan-2018</p>
